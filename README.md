# React-Redux-Blog
This is a Single-Page Application (SPA) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The front end is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while also using the React.js and Redux libraries. The SPA navigation is set up using the react-router-dom package. The application's back end functionality is provided by an API that uses Node, Express, and MongoDB. With the app a user can use an API Key to access thier own personal blog where they can view posts, create new posts, and delete an old post. This is done by using the axios package to make requests to the API routes. The App also uses the MaterializeCSS library for some extra front end styling.
