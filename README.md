# React-Redux-Blog
This is a Single-Page Application (SPA) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The front end is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while also using the React.js and Redux libraries. The SPA navigation is set up using the react-router-dom package. The application's back end functionality is provided by an API that uses Node, Express, and MongoDB. With the app a user can use an API Key to access thier own personal blog where they can view posts, create new posts, and delete an old post. This is done by using the axios package to make requests to the API routes. The App also uses the MaterializeCSS library for some extra front end styling.

- When the user first navigates to the application they will be directed to the home page. Here there are display cards for each of the posts on the blog with the title displayed as well as a few preview characters of the post. From this page the user can either click on one of the cards to be redirected to the specific post page, or they can click on the round button on the bottom right corner of the page to open up a form to create a new post.
